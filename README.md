## Datasets for Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA)

1. SDU-TER: Spatial uniformly distributed tasks with number of tasks equal to the number of robots.
2. SDU-TGR: Spatial uniformly distributed tasks with twice as many tasks as robots.
3. SDC-TER: Spatial clustered tasks with number of tasks equal to the number of robots.
4. SDC-TGR: Spatial clustered tasks with twice as many tasks as robots.
5. TDU-TGR: Temporal uniformly distributed tasks with twice as many tasks as robots.
6. TDC-TGR: Temporal clustered tasks with twice as many tasks as robots.
7. TDU-ST: Temporal uniformly distributed tasks for testing task scalability. The number of tasks in each dataset increases by 10.
8. TDC-ST: Temporal clustered tasks for testing task scalability. The number of tasks in each dataset increases by 10.
9. TDU-SR: Temporal uniformly distributed tasks for testing robot scalability. The dataset contains 100 tasks.
10. TDC-SR: Temporal clustered tasks for testing robot scalability. The dataset contains 100 tasks.


Optionally, plot the datasets using the jupyter notebook in datasets/Plots/plot_datasets.ipynb
